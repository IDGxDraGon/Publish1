        <h3>
            It can be said that the basic difference between equity and equality is
            that judges are concerned with justice and fairness in everything that 
            comes to Hollywood regarding the legal systems in the country. So that 
            equity is the individualâ€™s rights to what he
            deserves and is entitled to receive, and this may not
            be equal for people with others due to the different types 
            of entitlement between individuals, while our aim is to reach individuals to a 
            place between them all and treat them in a similar way without any difference

                         also known as economic justice. 
                         This type of justice is concerned with the moral 
                         concern or material goods that individuals receive. The 
                         origin of this justice goes back to the social system and 
                         socialist principles based primarily on 
                         the principle of equality, and through them the effects 
                         of justice appear in society.

                         in which compensation is sought and its simplest form is
                         to offer an apology to return things to the way they were,
                         and to provide compensation to the affected parties.
